During my hack week project, I wanted to explore using Pubky as a personal file storage tool. Relying on big companies to sync your most valuable data can be risky. So, I aimed to create a simple app that would allow me to securely store my passwords on my home server.

Pubky offers complete control over how you store, sync, and manage your data, making it the perfect platform for an app like this.

Let me show you how it works.

Here’s the login screen—this is where you enter your private key as a hex string, like this.

If no previous data exists, the app will automatically create a new, empty data structure for you.

Passwords are organized into categories, so let's create one.

Now, let's add a new password record.

After that, you can easily copy the username or password to your clipboard, just like with any other password manager.

You can also edit or delete records when needed.

And that’s it! I hope you’ll enjoy hacking on Pubky as much as I did!
